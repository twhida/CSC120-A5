- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

    Initially, this assignment was quite intimidating. Although I was able to visualize the relationships between the objects, the difficulty I had in identifying when and where returns were meant to be called and the other notational details made working with Association all the more confusing. On paper, these relationships between classes made sense, but my inexperience with coding made it so that I spent the majority of my time wondering what the methods, and attributes were exactly supposed to be for each respective class.

    What had initially not worked was namely the methods, because I did not know what to write that they returned, even though I understood the concept. I also had trouble imagining how this Train would run without user input, as I had difficulty imagining the tangibility of the compilation and running of the program if there was no interactive quality. This is why I had player.name written into my originally submitted code, because I thought that in running the program, I would see the process of individual objects getting on and off the train.

    Coming back to this assignment has shown me how much I've learned, in that the instances of classes are now very natural to me, I understand fully the concept of a String being a type of class, and can fix errors in which types conflict. I understand what getters are supposed to return, and more than anything, I understand the simlpicity of things like what the constructor needs and what needs to be consistently passed through when trying to use an instance of a class. I believe that my biggest hurdle was in learning to conceptualize the Train and its object oriented process in the code without being able to see a graphic or a narrative-type representation of the Train. 

    If there is a student similarly struggling with understanding this intangible Train, I would reassure them that the point of this assignment is not to create a visual or interactive narrative of people getting on and off a train. Understanding the relationships between the classes and how their respective methods interact is enough!

    I imagine that had I made time to go to more office hours during this semester, that I would have felt much more comfortable with and understood this assignment earlier on.
